# Project Overview
    This is a robust, backend-only Airbnb clone designed to simulate the core functionalities of a vacation rental platform. Built with Python, Django, and Django REST Framework (DRF), this API enables users to seamlessly list, discover, book, and review properties.

# Project Goals
    The primary objectives of the StayHub project are to:

    Develop a comprehensive RESTful API for a property rental platform.

    Implement real-world backend concepts, including secure authentication, role-based access control, CRUD operations, and efficient database design.

    Leverage Django and Django REST Framework for streamlined API management, data serialization, and validation.

    Utilize JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure and stateless authentication.

    Prepare the backend for deployment to a production-like hosting environment.

# Technology Stack
    The StayHub API is built using the following technologies:

    Backend: Python, Django, Django REST Framework

    Database: PostgreSQL (production), SQLite (development)

    Authentication: JWT (using djangorestframework-simplejwt)

    Testing & Debugging: Postman

    Version Control: Git, GitHub

    Deployment: Render or Railway (target platforms)

# Core Features
StayHub provides a comprehensive set of features to power a complete property rental experience:

* User Management
Secure Authentication: User registration, login, and logout functionalities powered by JWT authentication.

* Role-Based Access Control: Differentiated access for Guest and Host user roles.

* User Profiles: Creation and management of user profiles.

# Property Listings
Listing Management: Hosts can create, retrieve, update, and delete property listings.

Detailed Listings: Each listing includes a title, description, price, location, availability status, amenities, and associated photos.

# Booking System
Guest Bookings: Guests can book available listings by specifying check-in/check-out dates and the number of guests. The total price is calculated dynamically.

Host Booking Management: Hosts have the ability to view and manage bookings for their properties.

# Reviews & Ratings
Post-Stay Reviews: Guests can submit reviews and ratings after completing their stays.

Average Ratings: Listings display an aggregated average rating based on guest reviews.

# Search & Filters
Location-Based Search: Users can search for listings by geographical location.

Advanced Filtering: Filter listings by various criteria, including price range, availability dates, and amenities.

# Feature Breakdown
   * User Management: This feature handles all aspects of user interaction with the platform, from secure registration and login using JWT to managing user profiles and roles. It ensures that users can be authenticated as either guests or hosts, providing tailored access and functionalities based on their designated role.

   * Property Listings: This allows hosts to effectively manage their rental properties on the platform. Hosts can create new listings with detailed information (title, description, price, location, amenities, photos), as well as update or remove existing ones, enabling them to control their offerings.

   * Booking System: The booking system facilitates the core transaction of the platform, enabling guests to reserve available properties for specific dates and guest counts. It ensures accurate total price calculation and empowers hosts to efficiently manage and track reservations for their listings.

   * Reviews & Ratings: This feature fosters trust and transparency within the community by allowing guests to provide feedback on their completed stays. It helps future guests make informed decisions by providing average ratings for listings, contributing to the overall quality and reliability of the platform.

   * Search & Filters: This functionality enhances user experience by allowing guests to easily discover properties that meet their specific criteria. Users can efficiently search by location and refine their results using various filters such as price range, dates, and amenities, making property discovery intuitive and tailored.

   * Payments (Optional / Future)
    Integration with a payment processor like Stripe allows guests to securely pay for their bookings online. This feature automates financial transactions and provides a seamless booking experience.

   * Notifications (Optional / Future)
    The system can be extended to send email notifications for booking confirmations, cancellations, or reminders. This keeps both hosts and guests informed in real-time.


# API Security
    Securing the backend APIs is paramount for protecting sensitive data, maintaining user trust, and ensuring the integrity of the platform. This project will implement several key security measures:

    Authentication: This verifies the identity of users attempting to access the API. For StayHub, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be used for secure and stateless authentication, ensuring that only legitimate and recognized users can interact with restricted endpoints. This is crucial for protecting user accounts and their associated personal and booking data.

    Authorization: Once authenticated, authorization determines what specific resources a user is permitted to access or actions they can perform based on their role (Guest or Host). This measure prevents unauthorized access to sensitive operations, such as a Guest attempting to manage a Host's property listings or a Host accessing another Host's bookings, thereby safeguarding both user data and property management integrity.

    Rate Limiting: This mechanism controls the number of API requests a user or IP address can make within a given timeframe. Implementing rate limiting helps prevent abuse, such as brute-force attacks on login endpoints, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and excessive data scraping, ensuring the stability and availability of the API for all legitimate users. This protects the overall system performance and prevents malicious activities.

# CI/CD Pipeline
    What is CI/CD?
    CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a development practice that automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code.

    Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that every code change is automatically tested and merged into the main branch without breaking the application.

    Continuous Deployment (CD) automatically deploys these changes to the production or staging environment after successful tests.

    Why It Matters for This Project
    Implementing a CI/CD pipeline in StayHub helps ensure:

    Faster development cycles with automated testing and deployment

    Higher code quality through consistent integration and validation

    Reduced human error during manual deployments

    Early detection of bugs or security issues

    Confidence in production releases knowing they’ve been thoroughly tested

    🔧 Tools & Technologies
    The following tools can be used to implement CI/CD for this project:

    GitHub Actions – Automates testing and deployment workflows directly from GitHub repositories.

    Docker – Ensures consistent environments for development, testing, and production.

    Render / Railway – For automated backend deployment on code push.

    PostgreSQL – Integrated in development and CI environments for testing DB functionality.

    Coverage.py / Pytest – For automated testing and coverage reporting.
